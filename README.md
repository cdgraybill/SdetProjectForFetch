## Hello, Fetch Rewards Team!
###### ...and anyone else who comes across this repo :)

Here is my solution for the SDET Challenge. This is a guide to take you through the steps in order to run my script. As pointed out in the instructions, 
this guide assumes the user is ***completely unfamiliar*** with the langauges/software used here. Feel free to skip past any steps you deem unnecessary.

<br>

**1. Download Visual Studio Community 2019.**
* You can download the Community version at this link, as well as get steps to help you through the installation: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/install-visual-studio?view=vs-2019
* When reaching "Step 4 - Choose workloads", you will select ".Net Desktop Development" and "Universal Windows Platform Development"
* You can also skip all of the optional steps in the guide as they are not necessary for this demonstration

<br>

**2. Download the code**
* On this page. Click the green "Code" button. For this demonstration, we'll just download the .ZIP file.

* Unzip the file

<br>

**3. Open the solution file**

<br>

**4. Clean and build the solution**
* As a precaution, we will clean and build the solution. In the top left corner, you will see the "Build" tab.
* From there, click "Clean Solution" and then "Build Solution." They must be done in that order.
