###### ...and anyone else who comes across this repo :)

Here is my solution for the SDET Challenge. This is a guide to take you through the steps in order to run my script. As pointed out in the instructions, 
this guide assumes the user is *completely unfamiliar* with the langauges and software used here.

**1. Download Visual Studio Community 2019.**
* You can download the Community version at this link, as well as get steps to help you through the installation: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/install-visual-studio?view=vs-2019
* When reaching "Step 4 - Choose workloads", you will select ".Net Desktop Development" and "Universal Windows Platform Development"
* You can also skip all of the optional steps in the guide as they are not necessary for this demonstration
